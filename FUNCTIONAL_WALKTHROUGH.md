# Functional Walkthrough: Request Flow Through Ferrum Gateway
I'll walk you through how an API request flows through the Ferrum Gateway codebase, following the path from the client request to the backend response. This will give you a clear understanding of the internal architecture and help identify potential optimizations.

## 1. Program Initialization and Startup
Before any requests come in, the gateway initializes through these files:

src/main.rs: Entry point that parses environment variables and determines the operation mode
src/modes/[mode].rs: Specific mode initialization (database, file, control_plane, or data_plane)

src/config/*.rs: Configuration loading from files or database

src/dns/cache.rs: DNS cache prewarming for all backend hosts

src/proxy/mod.rs: Proxy server initialization

During this initialization phase:

DNS entries for all backends are pre-warmed
Configuration is loaded
HTTP(S) servers are started
Plugin system is initialized

## 2. Client Request Arrival (HTTP Path)
When an API client makes a request to an HTTPS proxy endpoint:

src/proxy/mod.rs → start_http_server():
The HTTP server accepts the connection
A new request object is created

src/proxy/mod.rs → handle_request():
The request is passed to the router for matching

src/proxy/router.rs → match_route():
Matches the request path against configured proxies
If a match is found, extracts path parameters
If no match, returns 404

src/proxy/handler.rs → ProxyHandler.handle():
The matched proxy configuration is passed along with the request

## 3. Plugin Execution (Pre-Proxy Phase)
After the route is matched, but before forwarding to the backend:

src/proxy/handler.rs → run_pre_proxy_plugins():
Creates a RequestContext with the proxy info and client IP
Calls the plugin manager to execute plugins

src/plugins/mod.rs → PluginManager.run_pre_proxy_plugins():
Determines active plugins for this proxy

Executes plugins in this order:

on_request_received: Initial request modification
authenticate: Consumer identification
authorize: Permission checking
before_proxy: Final request transformation

src/plugins/[plugin_name]/mod.rs → Plugin traits:
Each plugin performs its specific function
Can modify request headers, body, etc.
Can reject the request early if needed
If any plugin rejects the request (returns false), the process ends here with an appropriate error response.

## 4. Backend Request Preparation
If all plugins allow the request to proceed:

src/proxy/handler.rs → resolve_backend_host():
Uses the DNS cache to resolve the backend hostname
Returns cached IP to avoid DNS lookup in the hot path

src/proxy/handler.rs → build_backend_uri():
Constructs the backend URI with the resolved IP
Applies path transformations if configured

src/proxy/handler.rs → prepare_backend_request():
Creates a new request to the backend
Copies/transforms headers from the original request
Sets the Host header to original backend hostname
Adds X-Forwarded-* headers

## 5. Backend Request Execution
The gateway now forwards the request to the backend:

src/proxy/handler.rs → http_client.request():
Sends the prepared request to the backend
Records timing metrics (backend TTFB, etc.)
Handles connection errors
Waits for backend response:
The backend processes the request and returns a response
Or timeout/error occurs

## 6. Plugin Execution (Post-Proxy Phase)
After receiving the backend response:

src/proxy/handler.rs → run_post_proxy_plugins():
Passes the backend response to the plugin manager

src/plugins/mod.rs → PluginManager.run_post_proxy_plugins():
Executes the after_proxy hook on all active plugins
Plugins can modify the response headers/body

src/proxy/handler.rs → run_log_plugins():
Executes the log hook on all active plugins
These run in parallel to avoid blocking the response

## 7. Response Return to Client
Finally, the gateway returns the response to the client:

src/proxy/handler.rs → final response:
Returns the (possibly modified) response to the HTTP server
Records total latency metrics

src/proxy/mod.rs → handle_request():
The HTTP server sends the response back to the client

## 8. Key Observations and Potential Improvements
From this walkthrough, I notice a few interesting aspects:

DNS Optimization: The DNS cache prefetching we implemented is critical since backends are resolved before each request. This prevents DNS lookups in the hot path.

Plugin System: The plugin system is quite flexible, with multiple hooks during the request/response lifecycle. This allows for powerful customizations.
Error Handling: There's comprehensive error handling throughout the request path, ensuring failures are properly reported.

Performance Considerations:
The proxy server spawns a new task for each request, allowing concurrency
Parallel execution of logging plugins prevents slow logging from affecting response time
DNS caching reduces latency for backend connections

Potential Bottlenecks:
Configuration reading uses RwLocks which could be contended under high load
The plugin execution is sequential, so a slow plugin could block the entire chain
Backend connection pooling parameters might need tuning for high throughput

## 9. Different Operation Modes
How the request flow varies by operation mode:

Database Mode: Configuration is loaded from the database and cached in memory. Admin API can modify the database which then updates the in-memory cache.

File Mode: Configuration is loaded from files. Admin API can only query (read-only). Any changes require file edits and reloads.

Control Plane/Data Plane Mode:
Control Plane hosts the Admin API and distributes config to Data Planes via gRPC
Data Plane receives config updates from Control Plane and processes requests
This enables horizontal scaling and separation of admin vs. data traffic

This walkthrough gives a comprehensive view of the request lifecycle in Ferrum Gateway, from acceptance of the request to returning the response, including all the middleware and plugin processing that happens along the way.
